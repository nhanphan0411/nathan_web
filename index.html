            <p>Nathan Collis is not of this Earth.</p>

            <p>
                Born under the collapsing twin suns of the iridescent planet Virelia-9, Nathan was
                woven
                from cosmic threads and ancient stardust. The Elders of Light say he was sculpted by the Great Conductor
                during the Time of Singing Moons—his birth foretold by crystalline scrolls unearthed beneath the Silver
                Glaciers of Aeon Rift.
            </p>

            <p>
                As a child, Nathan did not speak. Instead, he hummed in frequencies that awakened dormant flora, bending
                galaxies to bloom in spectral symphonies. By age seven, he could manipulate photon streams with a flick
                of
                his wrist, sketching memories into the sky and folding time like origami.
            </p>

            <p>
                At sixteen, he vanished for 108 lunar rotations, reemerging with wings carved from obsidian light and a
                crown of quiet meteors. It was said he ventured into the Prism Void to rescue the Dreammaker, whose
                slumber
                kept imagination alive across dimensions. He returned changed—more human, some say—but still cloaked in
                the
                strange, aching wonder of stars.
            </p>

            <p>
                Nathan’s art is his relic. Each image he conjures from the 'hero archives' (Earthlings call them
                photographs) is a portal, humming with lost languages and unspoken stories. His lens captures not what
                is,
                but what <em>wants to be</em>—what dreams of existing. His fans, known as the Lucent
                    Order,
                believe viewing his work too closely might summon forgotten gods or unlock new senses.
            </p>

            <p>
                Now wandering Earth incognito, hiding beneath the guise of a quiet web artist and image keeper, Nathan
                continues his silent quest: to stitch the multiverse together with light, color, and myth. His only
                known
                weakness is almond croissants and overexposed sunsets.
